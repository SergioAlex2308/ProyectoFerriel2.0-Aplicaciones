Preserve the history of the railroad is the goal of this project, so do that the development team proposed create an interactive web application.

For each station, the user could see a low-poly, three-dimensional replica. In every station the user will find history information, images and some data curiosities.

Preserving the history of the railroad is the goal of this project.

### If you wanna see the design process visit my Behance profile by clicking [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/150069589/Ferriel-Web).

Creating this project was a challenge because it was the first time I used VueJs with Threejs, but the result is satisfying, I get to implement animation and camera movements with keyboard input, besides the user can use the mouse to look around in the first person view and interact with the informative labels.

## The workflow was as follows.

- Gather information from each station.
- Specific project scope.
- Select a Web technology to use.
- Create a visual identity (wireframe, Mockups, Logo, Colors, Fonts).
- Implement VueJS with ThreeJS.
- Create 3D models and props.
- Implement animation and camera movements.
- Unify interactive controls with 3D models.
- Add DarkMode.
- Deployment.


### So [here](ferrielweb.netlify.app/) is the result.
